# Digital Communications

This repository provides instructional material for 
digital communications.  The material is used for 
*EL-GY 6013: Digital Communications* taught at NYU Tandon
by [Sundeep Rangan](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/):

Anyone is free to use and copy this material (at their own risk!).
But, please cite the material if you use the material in your own class.

## Pre-requisites

The class assumes graduate probability (stochastic processes) and 
undergraduate probability.  Familiarity with MATLAB or equivalent language is
preferred.  

## Using github 
All the files in this repository are hosted on [github](https://github.com/).
